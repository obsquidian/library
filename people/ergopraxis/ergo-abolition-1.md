@DEIAgainstMoms It's eminently predictable for deep, desert-based retributivists who at most adopt anti-carceral rhetoric for 
social reasons and always distort it into honour-based defence of privatised justice in the form of vigilantism and vendettas 
(i.e. fascists) to dislike defence attorneys

@DEIAgainstMoms The real issue here is that we take these people seriously when they call themselves leftists, anarchists, or 
prison abolitionists, when both their motivating passions and sense of criminal justice are 1:1 with the standard reactionary 
reflexes of law and order types.

@DEIAgainstMoms They are prison abolitionists in the sense that Scalia was spearheading the decarceral movement when he argued 
that public humiliation and corporal punishment as an alternative to imprisonment could be constitutional. The pillory, after all, 
is not a prison.

@DEIAgainstMoms It's all a bunch of tedious, pedantic rationalisations to support exercising brute violence against unpesons 
(whoever the permission structure du jour singles out as deserving of sadistic treatment) to augment their feeling of power, and 
not feel as weak and pathetic as they are.

@DEIAgainstMoms The hatred of defence lawyers here is qualitatively and causatively identical to the hatred of defence lawyers by 
out and out reactionaries. They get in the way of our redemptive violence (whether exercised by the actual cops or popular self-
deputised mobs)
