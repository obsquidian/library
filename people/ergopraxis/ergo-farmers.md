No farmers, no food, when food but no farmers 

pls The State ban all the farmerless food, maybe if you artificially starve the people I can keep getting superprofits through my 
humble and honest work (torturing and murdering mammals down at the dungeon)

Reminder that agricapitalists ("""farmers""") are feudal residue with by far and away the most reactionary views in modern 
society, and the wholesale destruction of their way of life through urbanization and the collapse of their interests would also be 
politically excellent

We're talking about a utopian world where a) animals are not being systematically killed, b) we get all the meat we want 
regardless, c) food is cheaper, and d) this obnoxious, putrid political interest group collapses.
