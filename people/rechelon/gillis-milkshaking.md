Whatever some idiots on youtube say to try and redefine the term, there are actual historical "classical liberals" and they argued 
against nationalism and borders. There are current modern day folks who continue their tradition and they argue against borders 
and nationalism, from the Libertarian Party to the Adam Smith Institute. I may have many disagreements with them, but they have 
far better of a claim to "liberalism" in its classic meaning than fucking Sargon of all reactionaries.

Nationalism is collectivism and about as far from individualism and classical liberalism as shit gets.

Nationalism has long been beyond the pale in public discourse in no small part to the work of both classical liberals, modern 
liberals, and leftists. As well as a number of conservatives who fought it at least to some degree Reagan and Buckley for example. 
Nationalism is the constraint of freedom of movement/association/information. It is as fundamentally anti-free speech as an 
ideology can get because it carves up humanity into walled prisons. I'm an old school free-speech absolutist of the '96 
Declaration Of The Independence Of Cyberspace era, and we're all anti-nationalist (and anti-IP etc) because those struggles are 
clearly the same fucking thing. Saying that you'd allow some information to flow across borders but not others -- and not 
individual humans -- is not a free speech position.

Just as it is legitimate to punch a censor, so it is legitimate to punch a nationalist. This should not be done by states, because 
that would risk runaway authoritarian power, it should be done by individuals exercising their agency, from the bottom up.

You're trapped in both 1) bootlicking nations, the arbitrary collectives that are enemies of individualism, 2) bootlicking borders 
one of the greatest possible constraints of free association and freedom of information, 3) bootlicking police because you think 
individuals shouldn't take up arms themselves but leave all resistance to authority to one big authority -- the state, 4) 
bootlicking the state's deontological legal system so that you conceive of freedom of speech in the most myopic of deontological 
terms rather than in the full context of a society and what is possible within it.

Now fuck off forever you absolute authoritarian scum.
