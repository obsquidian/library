> "if you get rid of the state, won't people inherently turn to collectivist group institutions for support? like how the clan formed the 
basis of society in stateless somalia"

**anarchism is not just statelessness.** pre-state tribes were largely not anarchist due to hierarchies and other subtle means of oppression. 
Somalia is a failed state with its remnants fighting over each other: it's a statist civil war. as Bellegarrigue pointed out in his 
Anarchist Manifesto, governmental institutions create the preconditions for civil war. the second there is a distinction between ruler and 
ruled--no matter how soft, e.g., even the best state-oriented political liberalism would make it--there is a class antagonism between the 
ruler and the ruled. inevitably, as backed by just history itself, this will spill into social discohesion and causes for domestic civil war 
(and expansive 'normal' war) for whatever historically and culturally bound causal reason brought it about at any given point in time. it 
may be true that people will inevitably create oppressive hierarchical structures, but that would just make me a philosophical anarchist + a 
futilitarian in practical theory. **better for our species to not exist than to eternally live without fully realized anarchic freedom and 
explosive, wonderful, pluralized realizations of our wondrously multi-coloured and mulit-tonal human natures.** yet 'inherently turn to' does 
a lot of work. what if it's just 'overwhelmingly likely'--as would be more plausible, and more epistemologically virtuous and humble? then 
we have a problem of *difficulty*. it shouldn't need to be said this mirrors the state-theorists own problem: the fact that their ideal 
governments never even come close to aligning with the horrors of real-world governments. not even state-oriented political liberalism, with 
its federalism and constitutional genius, could really contain the monster based in violent conquest that is, in Nietzsche's words, "the 
coldest of all monsters"--the State. so, either we are in a doomed world where geopolitical elder gods toy with us for eternity, or we have 
at least a minute flicker of probability upon which the human race could finally be freed.
