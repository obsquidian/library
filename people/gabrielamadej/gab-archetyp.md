in light of the fact that left-wing market anarchism is filled with autists, squares, and nerds, i will take it upon myself to do a substantive article on Archetyp Market (i.e. not this thread), its rights-violating seizure by multinationally coordinated barbaric state entities, 
and the fact that, despite darknet marketplaces being robust counter-institutions and likely the only example of black market phenomena being unambiguously good and ethical entities that encourage prosocial norms and behaviour, it goes underanalysed by left-wing market anarchists 
for the just stated reason. the other reason is that many of them are tech illiterate and never even taken a gander at the front page of a darknet marketplace. make no mistake, however: darknet marketplaces succeed where all other sparks of agorism fail. 
they have robust escrow and review systems. the vendor receives their money when you can confirm that you have received your preferred product. they non-administratively involve testing popular vendor products through third-party, private labs. 
and it is trivially easy to avoid scams due to well-designed reputation systems. vendors, instead of acting like psychopaths ala many street dealers, are incentivized to be the best customer support on offer. 
you, quite literally, will never get customer support that good from a corporation. vendors often above and beyond to correct mistakes or lost orders. they carry a gentle, polite, quasi-professional, yet also casual tone. 
most of the time, darknet marketplaces ban immoral activities like ID fraud but, of course, allow the distribution products that are compatible with bodily autonomy. 

Archetyp Market had an explicitly ideological, liberal/libertarian/anarchist focus, 
and grew from a deep hatred of the War on Drugs. even going so far as to write a long-winded open letter to the governments of the world, as a kind of preemptive moral victory as they were all-too-aware that the meta-demonic institution, the State, 
would one day ruin their life and that of vendors caught in the crossfire for the 'crime' of making the world of drugs safe. 
the state is an extractivist, rent-seeking institution not compatible with adult, mature society that has discovered market economies, emergent order, and simple manners. it is time for statist children to grow up.
