'a market economy' does not require a *totalizing* market economy where-in every activity is under its culturally panoptical economic 
sphere. indeed, a huge focus in o.g. market anarchism - and resurrected market anarchism after the anarcho-capitalist distortion event 
(with some left-Rothbardian exceptions) - is that the destruction of the commons, the enclosure movement, the combination acts, the 
auctioning of land to privileged aristocrats in the colonies, etc., pre-figuratively guaranteed a ready class of desperate labourers for 
capitalists to abuse and use as wage slaves: once they were stripped of all meaningful bargaining power. this is the instance where 
'property is theft'; in more favourable conditions 'property is liberty.' yet because of these constant antagonisms it can seem that 
'property is impossible!'

**"Everyone but an idiot knows that the lower classes must be kept poor, or they will never be industrious." - Arthur Young, revealing the 
ass of the ruling classes.** 

what market anarchism is - in its original form - is a distinct brand of mutualism: focused on balancing the interests of property (which 
is symbolic for individual sovereignty) and community. if any force should overtake the other overmuch, disorder and poverty is the result. 
to have mutual aid networks that either exist outside or bend around the cash nexus is not only highly compatible with market anarchism, it 
is highly encouraged and desirable. so, communitarian-like institutional arrangements need not be abolished entirely: they just cannot be 
*dominant*, otherwise dog-eat-dog capitalism just gets played by different rules. charismatic people manipulating direct democracy councils 
--- or whatever model one has in mind --- to build up an analogous kind of "social capital" and exclude others from access to resources. as 
well, as you hinted at, the fact that labouring hands tend to resent idle hands - and i am naturally suspicious of purely communitarian 
arrangements for reasons like that. 

mutualism, by contrast, gives people a diverse array of motivations to work - for themselves, for society, as well as the means of existence 
for those unable or unwilling to labour themselves are mere materials for culture. (here i would agree with the anti-market ideologues 
that labouring as a mere material for culture in some grand economic chain is more dignifying, no less debasing than what pro-market critics 
point out in, say, soviet labour camps.) more independently, i would say that work is more rewarding when it has meaningful effects on 
communities around you - since i promote a form of economic localism - as well as when you own your own tools and get to control your own 
time schedule. when the distinction between art and mere work is largely abolished; same too with the distinction between mind-numbing work 
and 'brain work.' this need not be the call for absolutely everyone to labour up for either hashtag Society or hashtag The Market, but it is a 
condition that makes the idea of 'work' less horrifying

a chief concern here by market skeptics is something like the following: market spheres have an imperializing effect that overtake 
everything else - so the end result of unfettered markets is something like modern-day capitalism anyway. my objection is that this is 
conceivable and possible, but we have no reason to believe it's likely and give up on the best means of resource allocation and 
dissemination of information we have so far - especially since all historical examples we can point to required militaristic and legal 
violence to perform the aforementioned evil. absent these tools, 'the market' - and already abstracting it as 'the market' is missing the 
point, for it's simply an organic system we have discovered + constructed overtime yet also perverted it with technocratic and pre-
technocratic schemes  - should not be auto-assumed to be necessarily the imperialist monster that we have seen it to be when bounded up and 
used as one among many tools of "the coldest of all monsters": the state.
