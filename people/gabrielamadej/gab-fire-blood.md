it's interesting to reflect on how often representative liberal democracy met its failure mode before crystallizing into something that works. and how many currently European liberal states only figured it out in the 20th century.
which should give people pause when commenting on microcosmic failures of political anarchism (ala the CNT and Spanish anarchists.) it takes time and constant failure to bring about a new political order. liberalism was baptized in trials of blood and fire.

with the U.S. being an almost magical anomaly in getting it right after one revolution: itself due to institutional lessons learned from violent developments of democracy in ~16th century England and beyond. that is why Anglosphere countries were much more successful in
enshrining liberalism over their European counterparts. some liberals in Britain have this odd notion that they non-violently reformed themselves into liberalism. which makes sense if history starts in the 19th century. we're missing a few centuries of tension and violence there.
the English Civil War, while not exactly fought by liberals vs reactionaries in a robust sense, was crucial to the development of civic republicanism. here people could benefit from a Weberian approach to counterfactual causation in history.
where there are primary difference-makers in particular historical events, without which all sorts of derivative events would not have happened. the violent and turbulent nature of liberalism is part of those Weberian difference-makers.
i'm becoming sympathetic to a revolutionary experimentalist narrative, where even the worst liberal events were communicating an insatiable liberal spirit. despite frequently ending in short-term disasters, temporary autocracies, and restorations of oppressive monarchies,
they participated in the long-run trend of securing liberalism. i think many people straight up believe something like: “people were inspired by figures like Rousseau, Locke — whether directly or indirectly — and that's how we got liberalism.”
although they'll make casual mention of the Protestant Reformation and its relationship to freedom of the press and thus liberalism, it's not well-integrated into their understanding. and they discount the importance of the Renaissance and early liberals like Montaigne.
liberals should conceive themselves as still engaged in a kind of long-term revolution, fighting for a relatively unbroken tradition going back to the 1500s. one that has only enjoyed somewhat recent non-Anglosphere success. one that:
a] still needs to be desperately fought for across the world, b] is also facing significant domestic attacks that require a unified and self-conscious response. it's not as if we've merely
'tried liberalism that whole liberalism thing out and now there are authoritarian reactionary threats.' it's still an incomplete struggle as a historical whole. the final political form of liberalism is anarchism: radical republicanism and constitutionalism made manifest in
a realization of the pluralistic nature of social order. the centuries-spanning stability of Anglosphere representative democracy was once a utopian notion, just as market anarchism is foolishly derided as the same, yet it was obtained anyway.
one upshot from this general analysis is that liberals and anarchists should repudiate “anti-war” dogmas and take proactive interest in just war theory, international relations, and military history. there should, of course, be a strong presumption against enacting war.
and revolutions are always undesirable in the short-term: even civilization-threatening in the current socioeconomic condition of international interdependence. there are many scenarios in which we benefit from being “counter-revolutionaries.”
but the next millennium of the liberalism-to-anarchism pipeline will involve yet more blood and fire: whether through liberal empire-building or civil wars in the event of liberal institutions being desecrated. liberalism has no history without war.
as Proudhon once said, half tongue-in-cheek, always conscious of the horrors of war: “Hail war! . . . Why can we not see, instead, that it is a token of our greatness; that if, by some freak act, nature had made man an exclusively industrious and sociable beast and not a warrior,
“he would have fallen, on day one, to the level of the animals whose gregariousness is the sum total of their destiny; that he would have lost, along with the pride in his heroism, his revolutionary aspect, the most wonderful and fertile of them all?
“If we lived in unadulterated community, our civilization would be a stable.” this is, of course, a statement on the antipodal aspect of peace, not a celebration of wanton bloodshed.
