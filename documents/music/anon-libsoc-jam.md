#### ANON REDDIT : RADICAL LIBSOC POEM JAM SESSION

#### Not understanding what is said 

The person quotes a game

Not understanding the purpose 

Of the ideology they're trying to frame

For this pure essence of evil

Is direct democracy
 
The only evil here

Is the rule of the bourgeoisie 

.

A democratic workplace 

Is the place to be

Freedom for the workers

Liberation is the key

Collectively owned production 

Is mutual aid construction 

.

Never mind all the Stalinists 

Never mind all the oppressive states

For those still had a ruling class

Capitalism with a socialist face

.

Individual freedom is the essence

The goal towards which we strive 

And if that's what being evil is

Then that is how I'll survive. 

.

And now the time has come to edit

For fixing formatting on Reddit 

The iPhone parses text here weird 

One may even say it's... queer. 

I must say it's been fun, 

But with that terrible pun,

I leave thee with this edit note 

So you understand all that I wrote.

#### Communism ain't for everyone
Stalinists are massive scum
Trotskyists everyone hates
Even others who want total states 
Leninists want the ruling class
The workers can go eat an ass
Ancoms want the state removed
But the way they think is through
But me, I say just read Bookchin
Learn 'bout libertarian municipalism 

Workers revolutions east and west
Put old ideas to the test
The vanguard always failed
Hierarchies won't prevail
But in this world filled with mope
There is a place of genuine hope

Fighting ISIS out of Raqqa
The place's name's Rojava 
Surrounded on all sides
The ideologies collide
The Kurds and Arabs fight together
Unity now and forever 
A true leftist society 
People can claim they're truly free

Because Communism ain't for everyone 
But everyone with a heart under the sun,
Anyone can understand 
This world is run by the dishonest man
Hierarchies are a threat
Left and right, not the same yet 
But these people want to crush dissent
Kill all not in their party's tent
But communalists want freedom from that
Freedom from hierarchies, no caveat

For they bring naught but subjugation 
To all the people in a nation
Always serve the ruling class
It's the wealth that they amass
Left or right, it's all the same
We'll no longer play this game
Free ourselves in grassroots style 
Anarchism with a smile

So raise the black flag!
Raise the red!
Feed the people!
Bake the bread!
Bring freedom from tyranny 
Destroy this awful barony!

One step at a time,
We reduce the ruler's might
For every worker that we feed
Is another worker freed
With no need to work to survive 
Individual freedoms thrive

But a dependence built upon a state
Is a dependence that worth berate
You'd let yourselves be subjugated?
Let your freedoms be deflated?
Join us, dispossessed men, 
Have your liberty again

All who'd live before you die
Come give an honest life a try 
Organize under the black and red 
For the workers must be fed
