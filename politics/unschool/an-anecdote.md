when I was 11 I was given a non-verbal visual IQ test because I was too full of ADHD and latent anarchism to do the dumbass 
"required" essay to get into a "Gifted" Program like my mom wanted, because Alachua's school system is white supremacist in 
practice (the "Gifted" Programs cause pseudo-segregation within the schools they exist; school-to-prison pipeline for "mainstream" 
or "average" black kids to the extreme / they never got a real chance in school due to poverty and whatever else) 

to be fair, they gave me the most scientifically valid IQ test that exists: the Raven Matrices 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices

these test your reasoning abilities and how fast you can pattern-match pure visual shapes that gradually increase in complexity 

I scored 138, at age 11 ... 

(honestly, that psychologist held my core self-esteem in her hands and she knew, but she was a researcher, not a therapist, so she 
acted frustrated with my anxiety, and I know from the old psych interview report record in my files she very thoroughly read me 
like a book and I still can barely even look now, it's so unbelievably painful to be read like that at such a young age) 

haven't gone back, don't know what my adult IQ is, but I was considered Highly Exceptional (actual genius level is I think 145+) 
and that's purely how I got into my middle school "Gifted" Program 

:REE: now everyone in my life apologize for still thinking I'm r-worded 

(not really, I don't believe in demanding apologies because that's cringe; I prefer to let shit go, namaste) ðŸ˜Œ
