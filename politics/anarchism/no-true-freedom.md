#### ACCOUNTHAVER28 REDDIT : NO TRUE HUMAN FREEDOM EXISTS

Humans can never truly be free. We require other humans to meet our needs. If you were put in the middle of the woods without any resources 
(resources created by others) and any other person, you would probably starve and feel really lonely. The problem with sociality is that you 
have to follow rules to make sure everything goes smoothly, but oftentimes, these rules can be impossible to meet or stifle authenticity.

I posted to r/socialanarchism about how communitarianism scares the shit out of me as an autistic trans woman. They told me the goal of 
"collectivism" is to protect communities from exploiters and the conflicts I experienced with my social environment weren't me being 
exploitative. I think that is incredibly naïve. There are still going to be conflicts between individuality and sociality where it is just 
to side on the individuality side (and vice versa). Stirnerites, on the other hand, are incredibly naïve in thinking that an ethos of 
selfishness and a rejection of morality will not lead to bad people doing what they want without fear of consequence. A union of egoists 
means that an egoist who wants to rape or murder could find other rapists and murderers to form unions with.

But at the same time, capitalism and liberal democracy are much more oppressive to individuals than anarchism would be. In a capitalist 
liberal democracy, you spend most of your childhood being forced to learn stuff you may or may not be genuinely interested in to prepare you 
for being forced to spend your days working to just not starve (and many times, you do regardless). The ability to self-actualize is 
corrupted by corporations trying to sell you something. Anarchists are some of the strongest opponents of capitalism, racism, sexism, 
homo/bi/trans/enbyphobia, ableism, and other forms of oppression. The goal is to create the freest possible society and anarchism is 
probably the best way to do that.
