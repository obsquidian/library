#### ANARCHOPAC TWITTER : ANARCHISM IS MATERIALIST TOO

The anarchist argument against seizing state power is not "idealist". Its materialist as fuck. It goes as follows: 

**Premise 1:** a historical and sociological analysis of the state shows that its a hierarchical and centralised institution wielded by a small 
political ruling class

**Premise 2:** when humans engage in activity they simultaneously change themselves and the world eg workers go on strike, develop class 
consciousness and their abilities to self-direct their lives, win the strike and earn better wages. This is the theory of practice or praxis

**Premise 3:** the state is constituted by forms of human activity and so participating in the state produces particular kinds of people and 
particular kinds of social relations. Given P1 those who wield state power are at the top of a hierarchy and issue orders to those below 
them

**Premise 4:** this activity of ordering others about and having others subordinate to you transforms the political ruling class, irrespective 
of their intentions, into authoritarians who are concerned with preserving and expanding their power over other people.

**Premise 5:** those who are subordinate to the political ruling class - the majority of the population - engage in activity in which they learn 
to do as instructed (or risk the consequences of resistance), rather than self-direct their life and community through direct democracy

**Premise 6:** communism is a stateless classless society in which workers directly own and self-manage their workplace and community through 
workplace and community councils.

**Premise 7:** in order to achieve a communist society the majority of the population have to therefore engage in activities which transform 
them into agents who want to and are able to self-direct their lives and their community through workplace or community councils

**Premise 8:** given premises 1-7 seizing state power will never result in a communist society because it is constituted by forms of practice 
which are the wrong kind of activity for developing the agents that would build and reproduce a communist society.

**Conclusion:** communists should not seize state power because the forms of practice it relies on are a means which will fail to achieve the 
ends of communism. Instead the means will in practice become the end and the revolution will be destroyed in favour of a new ruling class
