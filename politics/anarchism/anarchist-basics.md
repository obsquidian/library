The Very Basics Of Today’s Anarchism

Written By Freddie PDX (Plural He/They)

Super rough draft of simple talking points about how and why the police, the rich, and the state are threats to the average person.

Cops are bad because:
• They serve to protect property and the state.
• Only people with money have property.
• The more expensive your property, the more they will protect it.
• They are modern day slavers. 
• They are not held accountable. When they are tried, the trial is often dismissed or they are found innocent more often than a lay person.
• Thus, they can murder and enslave without consequences.
• Thus, they serve the rich.
• Thus, they are the enemy of the people.
• Thus, they should be abolished. 

Rich people are the problem because:
• Corporations have the same rights as citizens.
• Corporations can only be created from money. 
• One person can own multiple corps. That means one person can have multiple votes. 
• They have the means to influence laws and policies in their favor.
• They contribute over 90% of all carbon emissions. 
• They have the means to solve the world's problems, yet they do not.
• They also are not held accountable for their actions because they can buy off the "criminal justice system". 
• The rich own 99% of all the wealth in the world.
• Thus, rich people are immoral and an obstacle to a better society. 
• Thus, the system in which grants them such power must be destroyed.
• Thus, because they are protected by the state, one must fight the state to fight the rich.

The state (i.e. the U.S.) is a problem because:
• It was built BY rich, white, straight, cis, men FOR rich, white, straight, cis, men.
• It is built to benefit only this group while creating obstacles for everyone else.
• It has, does, and will continue to use violence to maintain control while simultaneously condemning non-violent activists for demanding 
accountability.
• It has, is, and will continue to commit genocides, atrocities, and otherwise irredeemable and inexcusable acts against humanity without 
any significant resistance. 
• All acts of resistance of the state, regardless of how non-violent and peaceful it may be, always end up with the state using violence to 
stop the activists. 
• As previously mentioned, it is owned and run by the rich for the rich.
• As previously mentioned, the police protect its institutions. 
• Thus, the state is the enemy of the people.
• Thus, the state must be destroyed.
