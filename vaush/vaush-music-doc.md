Opinions on albums may change with time as I grow more familiar with genres and more accustomed to tropes/as my tastes broaden.

#### Ratings

★ - Very much not my thing, borderline unlistenable. Outright unpleasant, incredibly boring, or otherwise something I have no desire to 
listen to again.

★★ - I didn’t really enjoy this much, but it wasn’t actively unpleasant or offensive. Mediocre, or maybe just a little boring.

★★★ - An average rating for a good album. I enjoyed listening to this, but I wouldn’t actively seek it out to listen to it again.

★★★★ - Very good, definitely something I’d look to listen to in the future. Any music that makes me feel this way marks a successful find, 
because I’m not generally very excited about music.

★★★★★ - Transcendentally good. I rarely give media perfect scores even in mediums I actively seek out - video games, animation - so this 
album must have really impressed me.

😳 (Blushy Face) - I’ll be awarding this emoji to albums that really took me by surprise. Whether I loved or just liked them, this was not 
a sound I was expecting to enjoy as much as I did.
