### About (Extended)

This is my personal online text library. Everything that I want to keep and also share with the public is here. 

There will be a lot of overlap between folders. I decide where a piece fits best based on different factors.

Anyone wanting their own copy of the library or to correct what they see as mistakes is of course welcome to fork and/or download.

If you're the original author of any of these pieces and want one taken down, just shoot me a message.
