no

there are plenty of heterosexual pedophiles.
it’s just that they have usually very separate psychological damages that cause this behavior to occur. 

There have been theories that homosexual pedophiles are more ‘exclusive’ to children while heterosexual pedophiles tend to also be 
attracted to adults but turn to young children whenever insecurity levels are high.

So you could say that many homosexual pedophiles mentally were unable to grow up and were stuck attracted to children because they 
likely had to suppress their homosexuality (that is my theory) 

Wheras heterosexuals have a fear of judgement and responsibility, so they regress to children because children can’t talk back or 
judge them in that way. They feel children ‘understand’ them better and ‘accept’ them for everything, not realizing the reason is 
because those children simply don’t know any better. 

A lot of men who date young girls I’ve noticed are described as being “very sensitive”. Like, if these girls get upset with them, 
they will full on bawl their eyes out and these young girls associate it with being sensitive and a good person
But in reality they are just so incredibly insecure that they can’t handle people judging them. 

Overall, in both senses, this is a result of feeling sexually repressed and insecure with one’s own sexuality. Be it insecure with 
being gay, or being insecure with women. 

These folks need help. A lot of help. 

The painted image of a pedophile being some disgusting asshole who takes pleasure in harming children is generalized and often 
false. These aren’t sadists, these are people who just don’t want to grow up.
