#### Experiences on T pellets (AMA)

So /u/javatimes asked me to do this a while ago, and I've finally got a little time to write this all out. I've been on Testopel since June 2015, and finding it a really positive experience. A lot of guys aren't aware that T pellets (that's pellets, not pills) are a thing, and some know they exist but haven't heard first-hand accounts about them, so hopefully this will help some folks. I hope anyone else who's been on pellets will chime in with their experiences too!

This will be a wall of text, but I'm breaking it up as much as I can into bullet points.

Prior to pellets, I was on AndroDerm patches (which I do not recommend), Androgel (which I also do not recommend for effecting changes rather than for maintenance), and IM and then subq injections (mostly enanthate, occasionally cypionate). I'm not interested in debating the pros and cons of transdermal T in this thread; that's not the purpose of this post, so please keep that debate out of the comments here. Just wanted to give a little background. My whole transition journal is online [here](http://transboys.info/diary.html) if you want to read more about my experiences with all those types of T.

I decided to switch to pellets after talking to a couple of guys here in Boston who'd switched and had good experiences with it. I'm pretty sure they get theirs through Fenway Health; I'm not a Fenway patient, so I went through a urologist at Men's Health Boston. I've found them to be fantastic, both in general and in terms of Trans-savviness. (ETA: my urologist has moved to a new practice and I followed him there, and am very glad I did even though it's a significantly longer drive now. He's worth sticking with.) DM me for more info if you're in the area and looking for a doctor.

#### Some salient points:

- Testopel is a subdermal implant. It's implanted in subcutaneous fat in your butt, over to the side a bit, near but not actually on the hip. It's basically exactly where I did my shots, both IM and subq.

- The pellets slowly release T, giving you a steady dose that will last anywhere from 3-6 months depending on how efficiently your body absorbs it. The first insertion is done with the expectation that it'll last 4 months. Labs are done after 1 month and after 3 months to check your hormone levels, and when you go back for your second insertion after 4 months, you make a plan from there if anything needs adjusting.

- The pellets themselves ultimately dissolve completely, so there's no need to have them removed. They tend to take about six months to completely dissolve even if the T is used up faster than that.

- Doctors typically want you to be on some other form of T for at least a year prior to going on pellets, because they want to have a sense of what dose works well for you.

- Insertion is done by the doctor making a small incision (3mm according to my doctor), then inserting a hollow needle, through which they send about six pellets. The pellets are each about the size of a grain of rice. This takes two or three minutes total, and then they put a couple of steri-strips on the incision - no stitches - and send you on your way.

- The most painful part of the whole procedure is the local anesthetic. They shoot your butt full of quite a lot of lidocaine (roughly 15mL), so the actual insertion is painless, but the lidocaine is delivered via four injections to the muscle. This takes maybe two minutes, and it's that deep-muscle-soreness kind of hurt, not the sharp stabby kind of hurt that some shots give you.

- Because the entire thing takes 15 minutes or less - a few minutes to prep and inject your butt with lidocaine, five minutes or so to let the lidocaine set in, then a few minutes for the procedure itself - it is billed as a regular doctor's visit, not as surgery, even though technically it is outpatient surgery. That makes it way cheaper.

- Both the procedure itself and the Testopel are 100% covered by my insurance, so the entire thing costs me an $18 copay each time. This works out to a grand total of $6 per month for my T.

- The lidocaine takes about eight hours to wear off. Once it does, you're sore for a few days or so. I've had two insertions so far and both have left me sore for about a week. It doesn't stop you from walking, sitting, or driving, but I found running uncomfortable, and walked with a slight limp for most of that week. (The limp was partly because I have a really low pain threshold and was being a baby, and partly due to fear that I would burst a pellet or something if I didn't treat the area delicately at first. My urologist assures me that that fear is unfounded. The only restriction I was given around activity was to not go swimming for five days. Otherwise he said I should probably skip my weekly karate class once after the insertion, but then could go back to all activity as normal.)

- You may get some bruising around the insertion area. I had no bruising the first time and some bruising the second time, which I think was partly due to how religiously I iced the area after my first insertion. I didn't have time to ice it very much after the second insertion. The bruising I had was completely gone after maybe ten days.

- The incision is held shut with steri-strips, and then you get a big gauze pad taped on top of that. You remove the gauze pad the next morning before you shower, but leave the steri-strips until they fall off by themselves, which might take a week or so. You may not want to have the water directly hitting the insertion area while you're sore, and you don't want to scrub the area because it's sore and because you don't want to prematurely remove the steri-strips, but otherwise there's no issues with showering. I just washed carefully and gently until the steri-strips were gone.

- The pellets do create a small lump under the skin - more flat and spread out, less of a big topographic anomaly. You can't feel a lump under you when you sit, even with your wallet in the way, but you can feel it with your fingers if you press lightly on the area. On a moment-to-moment, day-to-day basis, I'm not aware of it at all.

#### A few bits and pieces specifically about my experience:

- I had already been on T for nearly 15 years when I switched to pellets. 12 of those years were on injections, always between 40 and 60 mg weekly. Most of the time I was injecting 50mg/week. My first year injecting was IM; the rest of the time was subq.

- I had a hysto in 2010, while I was still on injections, and I did start absorbing T faster/better after that. My facial hair started coming in faster after about three days post-hysto, which I was not happy about. That was when I dropped to 40mg/week for a while, but I often didn't bother to be all that precise when I drew up my T, so I frequently wound up getting 50mg or 60mg instead. My levels were fine and I felt fine, so I wasn't bothered about that. But it feels worth mentioning that a hysto can affect how well or how fast you absorb T.

- I kept an eye on my energy level, mood, and libido after both pellet insertions. I had no noticeable change in any of them, nor did I sprout any new body hair or find that my facial hair was growing faster or have a voice change for the first time in years, or anything like that.

- My 1-month labs showed my T levels higher than I think they'd ever been, although they were still within the healthy range for a male of my age.

- My 3-month labs showed my T levels had dropped a whole lot. It was still within the healthy range, but it was a really noticeable drop from two months prior.

- In the month between my 3-month labs and my appointment for reinsertion, I started having what felt very much like hot flashes, except they were a lot milder than I remember them being when I was early on T. I wasn't as hot, and it didn't last as long, as I remember from before, so I wasn't entirely sure whether it was me or just September in New England. When I spoke to my doctor about it at my reinsertion appointment, he said he wouldn't be surprised at all if I were having hot flashes given what happened with my hormone levels.

- Given what my labs did, plus the mild hot flashes, my doctor suggested two options: increasing the number of pellets slightly so my levels wouldn't drop so low by the 4-month mark, or doing a new insertion every 3 months instead of every 4. Because my T levels spiked as much as they did in the first month, I didn't want to increase my dose; I worry that that would raise my T levels high enough that it would start to aromatize to estrogen. Having this procedure done four times a year instead of three isn't ideal, but it's a very small price to pay, so that's what we're trying now. Still ten pellets at a time. Depending on my upcoming labs, I may do eight or nine pellets on the next insertion.

I'm sure I'm forgetting things, so ... AMA?
