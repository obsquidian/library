"So, you want to get on welfare?" - A Serious Guide For The Bennies

So you decided not to kill yourself and want to get on the bennies (welfare). Great! The USA welfare system is better then you think, you 
just have to know what to do and how to work the system. This guide assumes you live in the city and have a disabled diagnosis. If you 
don't have one, you can get one, and I'll tell how below. This guide is for folks who have or are...

1 ] ...legal US citizens.

2 ] ...200-500 USD on hand.

3 ] ...a stable mailing address.

4 ] ...a living space in a major democrat controlled US city or state that has fucking money.

5 ] ...a stable phone number.

6 ] ...some kind of personal transportation. (I recommend a bike or a bus pass.)

> If you choose a bike: Get a cheap lock to keep the crackheads away. Walking sucks, anything's better than walking, even a scooter.

***** YOU *NEED* A PHOTO ID. Get one at the DMV. It's cheap. YOU NEED ONE TO CONTINUE! *****

> Open a bank account with 0 fees and with a "too big to fail" bank. So that when the economy goes to shit, you still get welfare 
payments. AGAIN, YOU NEED A PHOTO ID FOR THIS.

Cash EBT (General Assistance) cards have a lot of stupid restrictions you can bypass by having an online bank account. All you need is...

1 ] ...an SSN.

2 ] ...a DMV photo ID. 

That's it.

I'll pause a little here and talk some about STATE welfare.

If you can get on state welfare, apply for that first. They have SSI applicant assistance programs and Cash EBT that can help you out 
while you wait for SSDI/SSI. These programs may not be available in some states however. Search on the internet to find this information 
yourself.

Step 1 ] Now apply for STATE welfare. Make sure to apply for Medicaid. Also Food Stamps, and maybe Cash EBT (General Assistance) depending 
on your US State. I live in a blue state that has money, so there is General Assistance available.

Step 2 ] Wait until your Cash EBT / Medicaid / Food Stamps application at your local welfare office gets through. Most Cash EBT (General 
Assistance) have work requirements. You can bypass this by having a medical diagnosis. More on this soon.

Step 3 ] Get a mental illness diagnosis from a medical professional - probably a licensed psychiatrist. Use your Medicaid. The state 
welfare office (if you live in a blue state with money) will help you out with that. What mental illness you choose is up to you to 
decide.

So at this point I assume you have...

1 ] ...a Photo ID.

2 ] ...a Bank Account.

3 ] ...a means of transportation. (Again, I recommend a bike.)

4 ] ...Food Stamps and Medicaid. Also Cash EBT (General Assistance) if you really live in a blue state with money.

Step 4 ] Now comes the hard part: Go to your local social security office and apply for SSI/SSDI. Make sure you have a stable phone number 
and a stable mailing address as this is going to take some time.

Step 5 ] This might take months. Make sure to stay on your application by calling them.

Step 6 ] With luck and some interviews, you should get SSI/SSDI bennies sent to your bank account within a few months. Always call them to 
keep track of your application.

Step 7 ] If your application is denied look up a welfare lawyer and go to court. This is going to take a long time. That's why you should 
ALWAYS apply for local welfare FIRST. Federal welfare second.

Tip: For appointments ALWAYS arrive an hour early. (You will probably have to fill out lengthy forms before even seeing someone!)

SOME QS I KNOW WILL BE ASKED

Q1: Can I apply for SSI/SSDI directly?

A1: Yes but get ready to wait plenty. You have to eat during the waiting period too. That's why I highly recommend you apply for local 
welfare first. They might even have cash if you live in a deep blue state.

Q2: How do appointments work?

A2: ALWAYS arrive an hour early, no matter what happens. You can call to reschedule but the welfare call centers are always busy.

Q3: How do I know if my state has General assistance? (also known as Cash EBT)

A3: Use The internet. If your us state doesn't have cash relief you still have to apply for medicaid. Without local Cash EBT(General assistance), get ready to wait penniless for months.

Q4: SSI Or SSDI?

A4: If your parents allow you to use their work credits, Choose SSDI. If not there's a shitty asset limit you can't go under. It can be easily bypassed if you know what you're doing but SSDI pays more in general.

Q5: Can you live off general assistance (Cash EBT)?

A5: Local cash assistance is highly unstable. I highly recommend only relying on it while waiting on SSI/SSDI. local Cash EBT can change quickly with economic conditions. Last thing you want is local politicians cutting all Cash EBT in your local area and you starving to death. Get on SSI/SSDI ASAP.

Q: How the hell did you get all this info?

A: I browsed though almost the full archive of 4chan /r9k/ and wizardchan to get this info.

So In Summary: If you want the welfare money, get ready to work for it. All you need is a functioning brain, some cash and a drive to get on welfare. Make sure to assist yourself first, in the USA no one cares at all about a NEET. Help yourself out!

Whoever you are, I wish you luck in NEET life.
